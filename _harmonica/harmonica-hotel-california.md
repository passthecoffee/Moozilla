8  8  8   -8  -8   -8   8     8   8  -8  -8  -8  
On a dark des-ert high-way, Cool wind in my hair  
  
  8    8   -8 -8 -8  8    8   8   8   -8    -8  -8 7 -6  
Warm smell of co-li-tas, Ris-ing up through the air--  
  
8  -9  8  -8  7   7    8   7 -8  8  8   -8   7    7  
Up a-head in the dis-tance I saw a shim-mer-ing light  
  
-7  -8   -8  -8  -8 -8   7  -8     7  -8  
My head grew hea-vy,and my sight grew dim  
  
7  8   8  8   -8  -8    8  
I had to stop for the night  
  
  8    8    -9   8  8   -9   8  
There she stood in the door-way  
  
-7  8    8   8   -8   -8  
I heard the mis-sion bell  
  
 6 -8 -8   -8    7  -8 -8  8  
And I was think-ing to my-self  
  
  8    8    8  8   8  8    8   -8   -8  -8 7 -6  
This could be Hea-ven or this could be  Hell--  
  
  8   8   8  -8 7 -8   8  -6   6    8    -8  7  7  
Then she lit up a can-dle And she showed me the way  
  
 -8    -8   7  -8   -8   7   -8  7  -8  
There were voi-ces down the cor-ri-dor  
  
-8  8    -8   8     9  -8  
I thought I heard them say  
  
Chorus  
  
-9  -9   -9 -9  -9  -9  -9  9 -9 -9 8  8  
Wel-come to the Ho-tel Cal--i-for--nia  
  
  8  8  8   -8  -8     8   8   8  -8   -8  
Such a love-ly place, Such a love-ly place (background)  
  
  7  -8 -8   7  7  
Such a love-ly face  
  
  8  -9 -9  -9  -9  -9 -9 -9   9 -9 -9 8  8  
Plen-ty of room at the Ho-tel Cal-i-for--nia  
  
-8 8  8   -8  -8  -8 8  8   -8  -8  
An-y time of year,An-y time of year (background)  
  
-8   -9  -9   8   8  -8  -9   -9   8  8  
You can find it here You can find it here  
  
verse 2  
Her mind is Tiffany twisted  
She's got the Mercedes Benz  
She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys  
That she calls friends  
How they dance in the courtyard,  
Sweet summer sweat  
Some dance to remember,  
some dance to forget  
So I called up the Captain,  
Please bring me my wine  
He said, We haven't had  
that spirit here since 1969  
And still those voices  
are calling from far away  
Wake you up in the middle of the night  
Just to hear them say  
  
Chorus  
  
Welcome to the Hotel California  
Such a lovely Place,  
Such a lovely Place (background)  
Such a lovely face,  
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California  
What a nice surprise,  
What a nice surprise (background)  
Bring your alibies  
  
verse 3  
Mir-rors on the ceil-ing,Pink cham-pagne on ice  
And she said, We are all just pris-on-ers here  
Of our own de-vice   
And in the mast-er's cham-bers  
They gath-ered for the feast  
They stab it with their steel-y knives  
But they just can't kill the beast  
Last thing I re-mem-ber,  
I was run-ning for the door  
I had to find the pas-sage back  
to the place I was be-fore  
Re-lax said the night-man,  
 We are pro-gramed to re-cieve  
You can check out an-y time you like  
  
 8   8   8   8  8     8  
But you can nev-er leave
