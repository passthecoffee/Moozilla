Song:	 8    8   8    8   9   9   8 -8    7    7  8  
Have you seen the old man in the closed down  
 8  8   -7 -6   -6  7   7  7   7    7  -8   -8  
market, Kicking up the papers with his worn out   
  8     8  8   8    9   9  9    9    7     -7  
shoes? In his eyes you see no pride hands held  
 7   8   8 -9   8    -6 -6  7    7  7   7  7  
loosely by his side, Yesterdays paper telling  
 6  -6 -7    7  
yesterdays news  
  
CHORUS  
7  -9  -9  -9   8   8    9    9-9 8  
So how can you tell me youre lonely  
-8  -8  -8  -8  -6   -6   7  -7     6  
And say for you that the sun dont shine  
 8  8   8    9  9   9   8   -8   7   -7    7  
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through  
-8    8    -9  8  6    -6   -6    7   7   7  
the streets of London. Ill show you something  
7   6    6   -6    -7    7  
to make you change your mind.  
  
VERSE 2  
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets  
of London, Dirt in her hair and her clothes in  
rags? Shes no time for talkin She just keeps  
right on walkin Carrying her home in two carrier bags  
  
CHORUS  
  
VERSE 3  
In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven  
same old man sitting there on his own  
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea-cup  
Each lasts an hour and he wanders home alone  
  
CHORUS  
  
VERSE 4.  
Have you seen the old man outside the seamans mission  
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears?  
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity  
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesnt care  
  
CHORUS
