Song:  
 4   -4  5   -5  5   -4  5  -5  -6     7     5  
It's be-gin-ning to look a lot  like Christ-mas,  
 7 7   -7   -6  -5  
Ev-ry-where you go;  
 -5  6  -6  -7  -6  -5   -5   6    6   -6  6    5   5  -5  
Take a look in the five-and-ten,  Glis-ten-ing once a-gain  
-5    6  -6   -7   7  -7  -6   6   -5  -7  
With can-dy canes and sil-ver lanes a-glow.Â   
  
 4   -4  5   -5  5  -4  5  -5    -6   7      5  
It's be-gin-ning to look a lot  like Christ-mas,  
 7   7  -7 -6  -5  
Toys in ev-ry store,  
-5   6   -6  -7  6   -6   -6  -5  -5  -5 5  -5   -6   7    8  
But the pret-ti-est sight to see  Is the hol-ly that will be  
5   -5  -8   6      7  
On your own front door.   
  
6  -6  -7  7   -8 7  -7    7  -7 -6 -7   -6    6  
A pair of hop-along boots and a pis-tol that shoots  
-6  -7  7    7  -7  -6   6  -5  
Is the wish  of Bar-ney and Ben;  
-7     7    -7   -6   -7   -6  6  -6  6   -5  
Dolls that will talk  and will go for a walk  
6  -6   -7   -7 -6  6   -5   5  
Is the hope  of Ja-nice and Jen;  
 5   8   -8  -8   7   -7  -6  6    -5    5    4   5   -5   5  
And Mom and Dad  can hard-ly wait  for school to start a-gainÂ  
  
 4   -4  5   -5   5  -4  5  -5  -6    7     5  
It's be-gin-ning to look a lot like Christ-mas,  
 7  7  -7   -6  -5  
Ev-ry-where you go;  
 -5     6  -6  -7  -6  -5   -5  6     6 -6   6   5   5   -5  
There's a tree in the Grand Ho-tel,  One in the park as well,  
-5   6   -6  -7   7    -7  -6   6   -5   -7  
The stur-dy kind that does-n't mind the snow.Â  
  
 4   -4  5   -5   5  -4  5  -5  -6    7     5  
It's be-gin-ning to look a lot like Christ-mas,  
  7   7   -7    -6  -5  
Soon the bells will start,  
 -5  6    -6  -7    6    -6   -6   -5  
And the thing that will make them ring  
-5 -5   5  -5  -6  7    8  
Is the ca-rol that you sing  
5     -5   -8   6    7  
Right with-in your heart
