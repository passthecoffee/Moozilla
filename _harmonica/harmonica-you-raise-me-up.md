Song:  
3   4   5  
When I'm down  
 4  -4  4    4    4   4  3  
And oh my soul's so wear-y.  
  4    5    -5  6  
When troub-les come  
 6   6  -6    6    5   -4  
And my heart bur-dened be,  
  6 -6 -7   7  
Then I am still  
 6   -7   -6   6   -5  6   5  
And wait here-in,  in si-lence,  
 3  6  -5    5   3   5  -4  4    -3   4  
Un-til you come and sit a-while with me.  
  
 6    -6  -7  7  
You raise me up,  
 6 -7 -6   6   -5   6    5  
So I can stand on mount-ains.  
 6   -8    7  7  
You raise me up  
 6  -7  -6   6  -5  6  
To walk on storm-y seas  
 6  -6 -7   7  
And I am strong,  
  6  -7-6  6  -5    6    7  
When I am on your shoul-ders.  
 4    6   -5  5  
You raise me up,  
 4   5     -4 4  -3  4  
To more, than I can be,  
 4    6   -5  5  
You raise me up,  
 4   5    -4  4 -3   4  
To more, than I can be.
