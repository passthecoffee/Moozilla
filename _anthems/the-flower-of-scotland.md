O [F]flower of Scotland  
When will we [C]see your like [F]again  
That [Bb]fought and [F]died for  
Your [C]wee bit hill and [F]glen  
[Bb]And stood [F]against him  
Proud [Bb]Edward's [F]army  
And [Bb]sent him ho[F]meward  
Tae [Eb]think [F]again

The [F]hills are bare now  
And autumn [C]leaves lie thick and [F]still  
O'er [Bb]land that is [F]lost now  
Which [C]those so dearly [F]held  
[Bb]And stood aga[F]inst him  
Proud [Bb]Edward's [F]army  
And [Bb]sent him hom[F]eward  
Tae [Eb]think [F]again

[C]Those [F]days are [C]passed [F]now  
And in the [C]past they must [F]remain  
But [Bb]we can still [F]rise now  
And [C]be the nation [F]again  
[Bb]That stood [F]against him  
Proud [Bb]Edward's [F]army  
And [Bb]sent him [F]homeward  
[Eb]Tae think again
