I"O<p>[Verse 1]</p>

<p>G                   Am
When the visions around you,
F                    G
Bring tears to your eyes
G                    Am
And all that surrounds you,
F                G
Are secrets and lies
F
I’ll be your strength,
G
I’ll give you hope,
C              G               Am
Keeping your faith when it’s gone
F
The one you should call,
Fm                             G
When you’re standing here all alone…</p>

<p>[Chorus 1]</p>

<p>C
And I will take
G
You in my arms
Am                        F
And hold you right where you belong
C                        G
Till the day my life is through
            F
This I promise you
              C
This I promise you</p>

<p>[Verse 2]</p>

<p>(same as verse 1)</p>

<p>I’ve loved you forever,
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never,
Will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we’ve won
And with this vow,
Forever has now begun…</p>

<p>[Chorus 2]</p>

<p>(same as chorus 1)</p>

<p>Just close your eyes
Each loving day (each loving day)
And I know this feeling won’t go away
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you
ooh I promise you</p>

<p>[Bridge]</p>

<p>Dm7              G
Over and over I fall
Dm7              G
When I hear you call
         C G       F
Without you in my life baby
Am                            G
I just wouldn’t be living at all</p>

<p>[Solo]</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>And I will take
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>Just close your eyes
Each loving day (each loving day)
And I know this feeling won’t go away
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you</p>

<p>[Outro]</p>

<p>Every word I say is true.
This I promise you
Ooh, I promise you…
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
