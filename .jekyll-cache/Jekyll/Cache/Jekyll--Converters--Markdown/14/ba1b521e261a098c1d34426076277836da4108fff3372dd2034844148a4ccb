I"A<p>She li<a href="/chords/E.svg" title="E major">E</a>kes to go huntin’ with her buddies<br />
She once killed a deer with just a st<a href="/chords/B7.svg" title="B Seven">B7</a>ick<br />
She likes old smoky bars and rotgut whiskey<br />
And ‘pull my finger’s’ still her favorite tr<a href="/chords/E.svg" title="E major">E</a>ick<br />
She like Hormel chili on her ice cream, ewww<br />
With a jalepeno pepper on the side<br />
She once fried bacon with her shirt off<br />
Chopped up and onion and didn’t even cry</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>

<p>She’s mo<a href="/chords/E.svg" title="E major">E</a>re of a man than I’ll ever be<br />
She’s done things most men can’t bel<a href="/chords/B7.svg" title="B Seven">B7</a>ieve<br />
She chews tobacco, swallows the juice<br />
Her real names Sheila but they call her Moose<br />
She’s more of a man than I’ll ev<a href="/chords/E.svg" title="E major">E</a>er be</p>

<p>She likes her old job down at the factory<br />
Even though she lost an arm in ‘83<br />
She spent a little time in Folsom prison<br />
And Johnny Cash is tattooed on her knee<br />
She’s never road a bull that’s ever thrown her<br />
Hell, she rode one all the way thru Tennessee<br />
She’s never met a man who’s ever owned her<br />
Although I think she’s got the hots for me</p>

<p>Chorus:</p>
