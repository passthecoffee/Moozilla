<p>Song:	 8    8   8    8   9   9   8 -8    7    7  8<br />
Have you seen the old man in the closed down<br />
 8  8   -7 -6   -6  7   7  7   7    7  -8   -8<br />
market, Kicking up the papers with his worn out <br />
  8     8  8   8    9   9  9    9    7     -7<br />
shoes? In his eyes you see no pride hands held<br />
 7   8   8 -9   8    -6 -6  7    7  7   7  7<br />
loosely by his side, Yesterdays paper telling<br />
 6  -6 -7    7<br />
yesterdays news</p>

<p>CHORUS<br />
7  -9  -9  -9   8   8    9    9-9 8<br />
So how can you tell me youre lonely<br />
-8  -8  -8  -8  -6   -6   7  -7     6<br />
And say for you that the sun dont shine<br />
 8  8   8    9  9   9   8   -8   7   -7    7<br />
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through<br />
-8    8    -9  8  6    -6   -6    7   7   7<br />
the streets of London. Ill show you something<br />
7   6    6   -6    -7    7<br />
to make you change your mind.</p>

<p>VERSE 2<br />
Have you seen the old girl who walks the streets<br />
of London, Dirt in her hair and her clothes in<br />
rags? Shes no time for talkin She just keeps<br />
right on walkin Carrying her home in two carrier bags</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>VERSE 3<br />
In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven<br />
same old man sitting there on his own<br />
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea-cup<br />
Each lasts an hour and he wanders home alone</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>

<p>VERSE 4.<br />
Have you seen the old man outside the seamans mission<br />
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears?<br />
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity<br />
For one more forgotten hero and a world that doesnt care</p>

<p>CHORUS</p>
