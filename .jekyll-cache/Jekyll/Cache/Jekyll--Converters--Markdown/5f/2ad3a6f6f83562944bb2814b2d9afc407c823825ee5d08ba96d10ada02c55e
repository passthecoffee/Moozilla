I"Á<p>[Verse 1]
C          Am
 When your legs donâ€™t work
          F             G
Like they used to before
C            Am                   F    G
 And I canâ€™t sweep you off of your feet
C          Am
 Will your mouth still remember
    F               G
the taste of my love
C          Am
 Will your eyes still smile
F               G
from your cheeks</p>

<p>[Pre-Chorus 1]
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G
Maybe just the touch of a hand
     Dm                            Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
Dm                 G (5 strums) -stop
And I just wanna tell you I am</p>

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Place your head on my beating heart
             F     G
Iâ€™m thinking out loud

And maybe we  found love right where we are</p>

<p>[Verse 2]
C            Am                     F           G
 And when my hairâ€™s all but gone and my memory fades
C        Am                      F    G
 And the crowds donâ€™t remember my name
C        Am         F                    G           C
 When my hands donâ€™t play the strings the same way, mmm
       Am                        F    G
I know you will still love me the same</p>

       C    Am           F     G            C  Am  F And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory

<p>[Pre-Chorus 2]
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
    Dm                       G
And maybe itâ€™s all part of a plan
     Dm                           Am     Am
Well Iâ€™ll just keep on making the same mistakes
Dm             G (5 strums) -stop
Hoping that youâ€™ll understand</p>
