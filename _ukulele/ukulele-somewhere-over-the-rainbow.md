| [C] [G] | [Am] [Fadd9] | [F] |

[Verse]
C  Em  F  C
Oooo, oooo, oooo...  
F  E7  Am  F
Oooo, oooo, oooo... 
  
[Chorus]  
C         Em
Somewhere over the rainbow  
F       C
Way up high  
F       C
And the dreams that you dream of  
G          Am      F
Once in a lullaby...  
     C        Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow  
F           C
Blue birds fly  
F        C
And the dreams that you dream of  
G                     Am    F
Dreams really do come true...  
  
[Verse]  
     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops  
G
High above the chimney tops  
       Am           F
That's where you'll find me  

[Chorus]  
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow  
F             C
Blue birds fly  
F       C
And the dream that you dare to  
G               Am   F
Why oh why can't I...  
  
[Verse]  
     C
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
G                                  Am   F
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
      C
Where trouble melts like lemon drops  
G
High above the chimney tops  
       Am           F
That's where you'll find me  
  
[Chorus]  
    C         Em
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow  
F          C
Way up high  
F       C
And the dreams that you dare to  
G               Am   F
Why oh why can't I  
  
[Outro]  
C  Em  F  C
Oooo, oooo, ooo  
F  E7  Am  F
Oooo, oooo, ooo
