[Intro]
[G]

[Verse 1]
I found a [G]love for [Em]me
Darling just [C]dive right in, and follow my [D]lead
Well I found a [G]girl beauti[Em]ful and sweet
I never [C]knew you were the someone waiting for [D]me

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we were just kids when we [G]fell in love
Not knowing [Em]what it was, I will not [C]give you up this t[G]i-i[D]me
Darling just [G]kiss me slow, your heart is [Em]all I own
And in your [C]eyes you're holding mi[D]ne

[Chorus]
Baby, I[Em]'m d[C]ancing in the [G]dark, with [D]you between my [Em]arms
B[C]arefoot on the g[G]rass, [D]listening to our [Em]favorite song
When you s[C]aid you looked a [G]mess, I whispered [D]underneath my b[Em]reath
But you h[C]eard it, darling [G]you look [D]perfect tonigh[G]t

[Verse 2]
Well I found a [G]woman, stronger than [Em]anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her [D]home
I found a l[G]ove, to carry [Em]more than just my secrets
To carry [C]love, to carry children of our [D]own

[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're [G]so in love, fighting [Em]against all odds
I know we'll [C]be alright this [G]ti-[D]ime
Darling just [G]hold my hand, be my girl, I'll [Em]be your man
I see my [C]future in your [D]eyes

[Chorus]
Baby, [Em]I'm d[C]ancing in the [G]dark, with [D]you between my [Em]arms
[]Barefoot on the [G]grass, [D]listening to our [Em]favorite song
