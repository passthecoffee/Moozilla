Dani and Lizzy - Dancing in the Sky
Capo on the fourth fret

[Verse 1]
 G                          D
What does it look like in heaven
         Em                           C
is it peaceful, is it free like they say
          G                   D  
does the sun shine bright forever
            Em                      C
have your fears and your pain gone away
        Am                           Em                   D
cause here on earth it feels like everything.. good is missing, since you 
  Em       C                            G                      D
left and here on earth everything is different, there is an emptiness

[Chorus]
                       Em           C 
oh I, I hope you’re dancing in the sky
                 G                     D
I hope you’re singing in the angels’ choir
             Em                     C
I hope the angels, know what they have
                G                           D
I bet it’s so nice up in heaven since you arrived

[Verse 2]
            G                      D
So tell me what, do you do up in heaven
           Em                        C
are your days filled with love and light
           G                        D
is there music? is there art and adventure?
                  Em                  C
tell me are you happy, are you more alive?
        Am                            Em                 D
cause here on earth it feels like everything.. good is missing, since you 
  Em      C                              G                     D
left and here on earth everything is different, there is an emptiness

[Chorus]
                       Em           C
Oh I, I hope you’re dancing in the sky
                 G                     D
I hope you’re singing in the angels’ choir
             Em                     C
I hope the angels, know what they have
                G                           D
I bet it’s so nice up in heaven since you arrived
             G
Since you arrived
