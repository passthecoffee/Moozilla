## 


[Verse 1]

G              C
Tale as old as time
G              D
True as it can be
G              Em
Barely even friends
               C
Then somebody bends
          D
Unexpectedly


[Verse 2]

G                  C
Just a little change
G                  D
Small to say the least
                  Em
Both a little scared
C                 
Neither one prepared
D                  G
Beauty and the Beast


[Verse 3]

                   D       C
Ever just the same
                D        C
Ever a surprise
             D
Ever as before 
                C
Ever just as sure
                  D 
As the sun will rise


[Verse 4]

G                C
Tale as old as time
G                D
Tune as old as song
G                   Em
Bittersweet and strange
                      C
Finding you can change
                       D
Learning you were wrong


[Verse 5]

G                C
Certain as the sun (certain as the sun)
G                 D
Rising in the east  
                  Em
Tale as old as time
                   C
Song as old as rhyme
D                  G
Beauty and the Beast
                  Em
Tale as old as time
                   C
Song as old as rhyme
D                  G
Beauty and the Beast
