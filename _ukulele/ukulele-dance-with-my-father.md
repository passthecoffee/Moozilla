[Intro]

Bb F Gm Eb

[Verse 1]
Bb                    F  Gm                        F         Bb
Back when I was a child, before life removed all the innocence
Bb                      Dm     Eb                       F         Bb
My father would lift me high and dance with my mother and me and then
Bb                      Eb
Spin me around 'til I fell asleep
Cm                                Bb
Then up the stairs he would carry me
Cm                        F
And I knew for sure I was loved
Bb              Dm             Gm           Eb
If I could get another chance, another walk, another dance with him
Cm                      Gm
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
Cm
How I'd love, love, love
F                       Bb
To dance with my father again 

[Instrumental]
Bb F Gm Eb

[Verse 2]
Bb                              F
When I and my mother would disagree
Gm                      F              Bb
To get my way, I would run from her to him
Bb                        Dm
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Eb                                   F        Bb
Then finally make me do just what my mama said
Bb                      Eb
Later that night when I was asleep
Cm                Bb
He left a dollar under my sheet
Cm                              F
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me
Bb               Dm               Gm             Eb
If I could steal one final glance, one final step, one final dance with him
Cm                      Gm
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
Cm
'Cause I'd love, love, love
F                       Bb
To dance with my father again
Eb                       F
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
Bb                         Gm
And I'd hear how my mother cried for him
Eb                       F
I pray for her even more than me
Eb                       F
I pray for her even more than me

[Instrumental]
Bb F Gm Eb

**Change in key from Bb to C!

[Verse 3]
C                               G
I know I'm praying for much too much
Am                          F
But could you send back the only man she loved
Dm                     Am
I know you don't do it usually
Dm
But dear Lord she's dying
G                       C
To dance with my father again
Dm
Every night I fall asleep and this is all I ever dream

[Outro]
C G Am F C
