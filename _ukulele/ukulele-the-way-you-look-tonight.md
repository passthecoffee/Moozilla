[Verse 1]

Ebmaj7  Cm7  Fm7              Bb7
Some    day, when I'm awfully low, 
Gm7               C7(b9)
When the world is cold, 
Fm7           Bb7                Ebmaj7  Cm7
I will feel a glow just thinking of      you
Fm7             Bb7    Ebmaj7
And the way you look tonight. 


[Verse 2]

           Ebmaj7  Cm7  Fm7                Bb7
Yes you're love  - ly,  with your smile so warm 
Gm7                C7(b9)
And your cheeks so soft, 
Fm7                  Bb7       Ebmaj7  Cm7
There is nothing for me but to love    you, 
Fm7             Bb7    Ebmaj7
And the way you look tonight. 


[Bridge]

Gbmaj7    Gdim7     Abm7       Db7
With each word your tenderness grows, 
Bbm7       Adim7  Abm7  Db7
Tearing my fear apart... 
Bbm7     Eb7(b5)    Abm7          Db7
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose, 
Gbmaj7     Gbdim7     Fm7    Bb7
It touches my foolish heart. 


[Verse 3]

Ebmaj7  Cm7  Fm7            Bb7
Love  - ly, Never, ever change. 
Gm7               C7(b9)
Keep that breathless charm. 
Fm7              Bb7                  Ebmaj7  Cm7
Won't you please arrange it ? 'Cause I love you ...
Fm7             Bb7    Ebmaj7
 Just the way you look tonight.
