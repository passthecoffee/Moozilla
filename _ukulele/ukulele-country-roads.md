## Country Roads

[A].  
[A]Almost heaven, [F#m]West Virginia,  
[E]Blue Ridge Mountains, [D]Shenandoah R[A]iver.  
Life is old there, ol[F#m]der than the trees,  
[E]Younger than the mountains, [D]growin' like a [A]breeze.  
  
[A]Country roads, take me h[E]ome,  
To the p[F#m]lace I b[D]elong:   
West V[A]irginia, mountain m[E]omma,  
Take me h[D]ome, country r[A]oads.
