[Intro]  
C F G C (2x)  
  
[Verse]  
[C]I set out on a narrow way m[F]any y[G]ears ag[C]o  
H[C]oping I would find true love al[F]ong the b[G]roken r[C]oad  
But [Am]I got lost a t[F]ime or two  
W[G]iped my brow and kept p[C]ushin' through  
[C]I couldn't see how every sign p[F]ointed str[G]aight to yo[C]u  
  
[Chorus]  
That every l[F]ong lost dr[C]eam led me to whe[G]re you [C]are  
Others who br[F]oke my he[C]art, they were like n[F]orthern sta[G]rs  
Pointing me [F]on my w[C]ay into your l[G]oving [C]arms  
This much I kn[Am]ow is true..  
That G[C]od blessed the broken road that l[F]ed me str[G]aight to [C]you  
  
[Instrumental] - C F G C (2x)  
  
[Verse]  
[C]I think about the years I'v[F]e spen[G]t just [C]passin' through  
I[C]'d like to have the time I lost [F]and give [G]it bac[C]k to you  
But [Am]you just smile[F] and take my hand  
Y[G]ou've been there, you u[C]nderstand  
[C]Its all part of a grander plan [F]that is co[G]min' true[C]...  
  
[Chorus]  
That every l[F]ong lost dr[C]eam led me to wh[G]ere you [C]are  
Others who br[F]oke my he[C]art, they were like n[F]orthern st[G]ars  
Pointing me [F]on my w[C]ay into your l[G]oving [C]arms  
This much I kn[Am]ow is true..  
That G[C]od blessed the broken road that l[F]ed me str[G]aight to y[C]ou  
  
[Solo] - C F G C (2x)  
  
[Chorus 2]  
And now I'm just r[F]olling ho[C]me into my l[G]over's [C]arms  
This much I kno[Am]w is true..  
That G[C]od blessed the broken road that l[F]ed me str[G]aight to y[C]ou [F]uuu[G]uuu[C]uu  
That G[C]od blessed the broken road that l[F]ed me str[G]aight to y[C]ou [F]uu[G]uu[C]uu (let ring)
