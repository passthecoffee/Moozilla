## Can't take that away


[C]They can [G]say anything they [Am]want to [Em]say  
Try to bring me [F]down  
But I will no[C]t allow  
Any[Dm]one to succeed  
Hanging c[G]louds over me  
And [C]they can t[G]ry hard to make me f[Am]eel  
That [Em]I don't matter at[F] all  
But I ref[C]use to falter  
In [Dm]what I believe  
Or lose [G]faith in my dreams  
  
CHORUS:  
'Cause [C]there's a l[E]ight in me  
That [Am]shines bri[F]ghtly  
They can t[Dm]ry  
But they c[G]an't take that away from [C]me  
repeat intro (C,G,F), E  
  
[C]They can [G]do anything they w[Am]ant to [Em]you  
lf you let them [F]in  
But they won't [C]ever win  
If you c[Dm]ling to your pride  
And just [G]push them aside  
See [C]I have [G]learned there's an inner [Am]peace I[Em] own   
  
Something in my [F]soul  
That they ca[C]nnot possess  
So I w[Dm]on't be afraid  
And dark[G]ness will fade  
  
'Cause [C]there's a l[E]ight in me  
That s[Am]hines brig[F]htly  
They can [Dm]try  
But they can't [G]take that away from me   
[Am]No, [E]they can't take this  
[F]Precious love  
l'll al[Am]ways have inside me  
[F]Certainly the [C]Lord will guide me  
[Dm]Where I need to [G]go  
  
[C]They can s[G]ay anything they [Am]want to [E]say  
Try to break me d[F]own  
But 1 won't [C]face the ground  
I will [Dm]rise steadily  
Sailing ou[G]t of their reach  
  
[C]Oh Lord  
They do [E]try hard to make me [Am]feel  
That [E]I don't matter at[F] all  
But I refus[C]e to falter  
In wh[Dm]at I believe  
Or lose fa[G]ith in my dreams  
  
'Cause th[C]ere's a lig[E]ht in me that [Am]shines bright[Dm]ly  
They[Dm] can t[F]ry  
But they can't[G] take that away from [C]me (G,F)  

(C,G,F)
