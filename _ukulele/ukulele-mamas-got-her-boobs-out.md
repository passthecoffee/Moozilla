[E]I remember way back when I was just a boy,  
going [A]places with my mom and d[E]ad  
It used to scare me to death, how mama used to act   
after s[B]ix or seven beers she'd have.  
We were si[E]ttin' at a table, when mama got disabled   
all the l[A]iquor runnin' to her h[E]ead.  
Soon I got to choking', cause daddy wasn't joking'  
when he[B] grabbed me by the arm and [E]said..  
  
Chorus  
  
NO Chord [A] [E]  
Don't look now,  
mamas got her boobs out  
showing everybody in town.  
My face was turning red,   
I was wishin' I was dead,   
there were [B]people standing all around.  
  
When [A]mama gets to drinkin',   
t[E]here ain't much thinkin',  
[A]there's nothing anybody can d[E]o.  
You just ho[A]pe and pray,   
there [E]never comes a day when maBmas out drinkin' with y[E]ou.  
  
Verse 2  
Well we got her in the truck,  
and we started driving home,  
when[A] mama said she had to[E] go.  
Daddy pulled it over we were standin' on the shoulder,  
while [B]ma was puttin' on a show.  
Daddy fir[E]ed up the truck, and mama stood up with her [A]pants down around her [E]knees.  
That's when I heard mama holler, if you give me a dollar, than I'll l[B]et you take a peak at t[E]hese.  
  
Chorus  
  
NO Chord A E  
Don't look now,  
mamas got her boobs out  
showing everybody in town.  
My face was turning red, I was wishin' I was dead,  
there were p[B]eople standing all around.  
When m[A]ama gets to drinkin',  
t[E]here ain't much thinkin',  
there's no[A]thing anybody can [E]do.  
You just h[A]ope and pray,  
there n[E]ever comes a day  
when ma[B]mas out drinkin' with y[E]ou.  
You just h[A]ope and pray,  
there n[E]ever comes a day  
when my m[B]amas out drinkin' with y[E]ou.
