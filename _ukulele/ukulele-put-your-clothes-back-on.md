## Put your clothes back on

Put your clothes back o[A]n  
I'd rather be al[D]one  
Your t[A]hing is all worn out  
now get on[E] home  
You've had [A]too many lovers, they've worn off the hair  
there a[D]in't no way i'm going in there  
put your [A]clothes on  
[E]and get on hom[A]e  
I should've never gone [A]out  
I should've never had a d[D]rink  
T[A]ake that thing outside  
It's starting to[E] stink  
Your [A]friends done told me where you have been  
and i[D] feel sorry for all those men  
now put your [A]clothes back on baby  
[E]And get on hom[A]e  
Yeah g[D]et that thing away from me  
It lo[A]oks like something your dog would eat  
i've s[E]een enough, now set me free  
i t[A]hink that thing just barked at me (woof)  
[D]Early this morning it bit my leg  
[A]oh little darling don't you making me beg  
Now put your [E]clothes back on  
and get on h[A]ome  
Oh shit i'm [A]scared.  
I need medical c[D]are  
I [A]think three midgets just crawled out of [E]there (Run boys!)  
Well [A]i was fine before you came  
would you t[D]hrow something over that pitiful thing  
Baby [A]put your clothes back o[E]n  
and get on h[A]ome  
[D]Yeah, put your c[A]lothes on  
and [E]get your booty back home  
go [A]on.
