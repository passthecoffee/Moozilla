## Clown

[Verse 1].  
[Am]I guess it's [D]funnier from where you're [G]standing  
[Am]'Cause from [D]over here I've missed the [G]joke  
[Am]Cleared the [D]way for my crash [G]landing  
I've done it aga[Am]in, another [D]number for your [G]notes 
  
[Verse 2].  
[Am]I'd be [D]smiling if I wasn't so [G]desperate  
[Am]I'd be [D]patient if I had the [G]time  
[Am]I could [D]stop and answer all of your[G] questions  
As soon as I f[Am]ind out,  
how I could [D]move from the back of the [G]line  
  
[Chorus].  
So I'll be your[G] clown  
Behind the [Em]glass  
Go 'head and [Am]laugh 'cause it's [C]funny  
I would [D]too, if I saw me  
I'll be your [G]clown  
On your favorite [Em]channel  
My life's a [Am]circus-circus, [C]rounding circles  
I'm [D]selling out tonight  

[Verse 3].  
[Am]I'd be less a[D]ngry if it was my [G]decision  
[Am]And the [D]money was just rolling in [G],  
[Am]If I had [D]more than my ambition [G],  
I'll have time to [Am]please,  
I'll have time to [D]thank you as soon as I win [G].

[Chorus].  
So I'll be your[G] clown  
Behind the [Em]glass  
Go 'head and [Am]laugh 'cause it's [C]funny  
I would [D]too, if I saw me  
I'll be your [G]clown  
On your favorite [Em]channel  
My life's a [Am]circus-circus, [C]rounding circles  
I'm [D]selling out tonight  

So I'll be your[G] clown  
Behind the [Em]glass  
Go 'head and [Am]laugh 'cause it's [C]funny  
I would [D]too, if I saw me  
I'll be your [G]clown  
On your favorite [Em]channel  
My life's a [Am]circus-circus, [C]rounding circles  
I'm [D]selling out tonight
