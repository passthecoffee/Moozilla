## More of a man

She li[E]kes to go huntin' with her buddies  
She once killed a deer with just a st[B7]ick  
She likes old smoky bars and rotgut whiskey  
And 'pull my finger's' still her favorite tr[E]ick  
She like Hormel chili on her ice cream, ewww  
With a jalepeno pepper on the side  
She once fried bacon with her shirt off  
Chopped up and onion and didn't even cry  
  
Chorus:
  
She's mo[E]re of a man than I'll ever be  
She's done things most men can't bel[B7]ieve  
She chews tobacco, swallows the juice  
Her real names Sheila but they call her Moose  
She's more of a man than I'll ev[E]er be  
  
She likes her old job down at the factory  
Even though she lost an arm in '83  
She spent a little time in Folsom prison  
And Johnny Cash is tattooed on her knee  
She's never road a bull that's ever thrown her  
Hell, she rode one all the way thru Tennessee  
She's never met a man who's ever owned her  
Although I think she's got the hots for me  
  
Chorus:
