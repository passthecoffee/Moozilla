When you [G]walk through a storm hold your [D]head up high  
And [C]don't be [G]afraid of the [D]dark[Dm]  
At the [Am]end of the [F]storm is a [C]golden [Am]sky  
And the [F]sweet [Em]silver [Dm]song [C]of a [B]lark[G]  
  
Walk [C]on through the [B7]wind, walk [Em]on through the [C]rain  
Though your [G]dreams be [Bm]tossed and [Am]blow[D]n  
Walk [G]on, walk [G7]on with [C]hope in your [A7]heart  
And you'll [G]ne[Em]ver [C]walk [C#]alon[D]e  
You'll [Bm]nev[Em]er [C]walk [D]alo[G]ne[D7]
