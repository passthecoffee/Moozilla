[Verses]
                            
[G]The old home town looks the same[G7],  
as I s[C]tep down from the tr[G]ain,  
and there to meet me is my mama and p[D]apa,  
[D7]down the ro[G]ad I look and the[G7]re runs Mary,  
[C]hair of go[Adim]ld and l[C]ips li[Bm]ke ch[Am]erries,  
it's g[G]ood to touch,  
the g[D7]reen green g[Am7]rass [D7]of h[G]ome-[G]-[C]-[G].  
  
[G]Yes they all come to meet m[G7]e,  
out re[C]aching, smileying sweetly[Am7],  
it's [G]good to touch,  
the gr[D7]een green g[Am7]rass [D7]of h[G]ome-[G]-[C]-[G].
