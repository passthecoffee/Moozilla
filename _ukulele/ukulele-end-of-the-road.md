End Of The Road by Boyz II Men

Capo 1


[Verse]

[D] We belong together [Dsus4] 
[F#m] And you know I’m [Bm7] right
[G] Why do you  [A] play with my heart, 
Why [G/E] do you play with my [G/A] mind?
 
[D] Said we’d be forever [Dsus4] 
[F#m] Said it’d never [Bm7] die
[G] How could you [A] love me and leave me 
and [G/E] never say [G/A] good-bye?
  
[Bridge]
  
When I [Bm] can’t sleep at night without [F#] holding you tight
Girl [D/A] each time I try I just [G#dim7] break down and cry
[GM7/G] Pain in my head, Oh, I’d [A] rather be dead
[GM7/E] Spinning around and [GM7/A]around
 
[Chorus]

Although we’ve [D] come 
to the [Em7/D] end [D] of the [A/B] road
still I [Bm7] can’t [A/F#] let [G2] go 
It’s un[D/F#]natural
You be[G/E] long to me. 
I be[G/A] long to you.


[Verse]
 
[D] Girl I know you really love me  
[F#m7] You just don’t rea[Bm7]lize
[G] You’ve never [A] been there before 
It’s [G/E] only your first [G/A] time.
 
[D] Maybe I’ll forgive you  
[F#m] Maybe you’ll [Bm7] try.
[G] We should be [A] happy together 
for[G/E] ever you and [G/A] I


[Bridge]
 
[Bm] Will you love me again 
like you [F#] loved me before
[D/A] This time I want you to  
[G#dim7] love me much more
[GM7/G] This time instead 
Just [A/F#] come to my bed
And [G/E] baby just don’t let me [GM7/A] go
 

[Chorus]

Although we’ve [D] come 
to the [Em7/D] end [D] of the [A/B] road
still I [Bm7] can’t [A/F#] let [G2] go 
It’s un[D/F#]natural
You be[G/E] long to me. 
I be[G/A] long to you.
