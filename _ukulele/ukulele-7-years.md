## 7 Years

[Intro]
[Em],  [G],  [C],  [D]  
[Em],  [G],  [C]  
  
[Chorus 1]  
O[Em]nce I was seven years [G]old,
my momma told [C]me,
go make yourself some friends or you'll be l[D]onely
[Em]once I was [G]Seven years o[C]ld

[Verse 1]
[Em]It was a big b[D]ig w[G]orld,
but we thought we were bigger[C].
Pushing each other to the limits,
we were l[D]earning quicker[Em].
By eleven [D]smoking [G]herb
and drinking burning liquo[C]r
Never rich so we were out to make that [D]steady figure

[Chorus 2]
[Em]Once I was eleven [D]years [G]old,
my daddy told [C]me,
go get yourself a wife or you'll be [D]lonely.
[Em]Once I was [D]eleven [G]years [C]old

[Verse 2]
[Em]I always have [D]that [G]dream
like my Daddy before m[C]e                    
So I started writing songs
I started [D]writing storie[Em]s
Something about that [D]glor[G]y,
just always seemed to bore me[C],                  
Cause only those I really love
will ever [D]really know me

[Chorus 3]
[Em]Once I was twenty [D]years [G]old,
my story got [C]told,
before the morning sun, when life was [D]lonely.
[Em]Once I was [D]twenty [G]years [C]ol[Em]d       

[Verse 3]
I only see [D]my [G]goals,
I don't believe in failure[C].               
Cause I know the smallest voices,
they can [D]make it major[Em],
I got my boys [D]with [G]me at least those in favo[C]r                
and if we don't see before I leave,
I hope to [D]see you later.

[Chorus 4]
[Em]Once I was twenty [D]years [G]old
my story got [C]told                  
I was writing about everything,
I saw be[D]fore me
[Em]Once I was [D]twenty [G]years [C]old

[Chorus 5]
[Em]Soon we'll be 30 [D]years [G]old
our songs have been [C]sold
we've traveled around the world
and we're still [D]roaming
[Em]Soon we'll be [D]30 [G]years [C]old

[Verse 5]
[Em]I'm still learning about [G]life
my woman brought children for [C]me
so I can sing them all my songs
and I can [D]tell them storie[C]s             
Most of my boys are with me
[Cmaj7]some are still out seeking glor[C]y
And some I had to leave behind
my brother [F#/D]I'm still sorry

[Chorus 6]
[C]Soon I'll be sixty [D]years [Em]old
my daddy got sixty-[D]one
remember life and then your [F#/D]life
becomes a better on[C]e
I made a man so happy
[D]when I wrote a [Em]letter once
[Bm]I hope my children come and visit
once or twice a month

[Chorus 7]
[Em]Soon I'll be [D]sixty [G]years [C]old
will I think the world is [D]cold
or will I have a lot of [F#/D]children
who can warm me
[C]Soon I'll be [D]sixty [G]years [C]old

[Chorus 7]
[Em]Soon I'll be [D]sixty [G]years [C]old
will I think the world is [C]cold
or will I have a lot of children
who can [D]warm me
[Em]Soon I'll be [D]sixty [G]years [C]old

[Chorus 8]
[Em]Once I was seven years [G]old,
my momma told [C]me,              
go make yourself some friends or you'll be [G]lonely
[Em]once I was [D]seven [G]years [C]old

[Outro]
[Em]once I was seven [D]years [G]old
