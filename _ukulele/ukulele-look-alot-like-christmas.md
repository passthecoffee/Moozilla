Its [G]beginning to look a [C]lot like [G]Christmas,  
e[B7]verywhe[C]re you g[E7]o  
Take a lo[Am]ok in the five-and-t[D]en,  
gl[D7]istening once ag[Am]ain,  
with ca[D]ndy canes and s[A7]ilver l[Am]anes ag[D]low  
  
  
It's [G]beginning to look a [C]lot like [G]Christmas,  
[B7]toys in [C]every [E7]store  
But the [Am]prettiest sight to se[B7]e,  
is the [G]holly that will [E7]be,  
on your [Am]own [D7]front [G]door  
  
  
A pair of [B7]hop along boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the [E7]wish of [B7]Barney and [Em]Ben  
[D7]Dolls that will talk and will [A7]go for a walk  
Is the [D7]hope of [A7]Janice and [D]Jen  
And [D7]Mom and Dad can [A7]hardly wait for [Am]school to [D]start [D7]again  
  
  
It's [G]beginning to look a [C]lot like [G]Christmas, 
e[B7]verywhe[C]re you g[E7]o 
There's a [Am]tree in the Grand [D]Hotel, 
[D7]one in the park [Am]as well,  
the [D]sturdy [A7]kind that do[Am]esn't mind the [D]snow  
  
  
It's [G]beginning to look a [C]lot like [G]Christmas,  
[B7]soon the [C]bells will [E7]start  
And the [Am]thing that will make them [B7]ring,  
is the c[G]arol that you [E7]sing,  
right [Am]within [D7]your [G]heart
