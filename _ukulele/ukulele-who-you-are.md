## who you are

[Verse 1]  
[Em]I stare at my [C]reflection in the [G]mirro[D]r  
[Em]Why am I [C]doing this to [G]mysel[D]f  
[Em]Losing my [C]mind on a [G]tiny [D]error  
[Em]I nearly left the [C]real me on the [G]shelf  
No, no, no, [D]no  
  
[Chorus]  
[Em]Don't loose who you [C]are [G]in the blur of the st[D]ars  
[Em]EmSeeing is [C]deceiving, dreaming is [G]believing  
It's okay not to be [D]okay  
[Em]Sometimes it's [C]har[G]d  
to follow your [D]heart  
[Em]Tears don't mean you're [C]losing  
everybody's [G]bruising  
Just be true to [D]who you are  
[Em]Who you are  
Who you [C]are  
  
Who you are  
[G]Who you are  
Who you are  
Who you [D]are

[Verse 2]
Em          C               G        D
Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
Em               C                  G
I forgot what to do to fit the mould
Em         C                  G
The more I try, the less it's working
Em              C
'cos everything inside me
        G                      D
screams no, no, no, no, no, no, no


[Chorus]

Em                  C  G                        D
Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
Em         C                     G
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
                 D
It's okay not to be okay
Em             C    G
Sometimes it's hard
                    D
to follow your heart
Em                      C
Tears don't mean you're losing
            G
everybody's bruising
                D
There's nothing wrong with who you are

[Bridge]

D         Em
Yes, No, egos
                C
fake shows like WOAH
             G
Just go, and leave me alone
D               Em
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
C
With a smile...
That's my home, yeah
Em
That's my home...

[Instrumental Solo]

Em C G D

[Chorus]

Em                  C  G                        D
Don't loose who you are in the blur of the stars
Em         C                     G
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
                 D
It's okay not to be okay
Em             C    G
Sometimes it's hard
                    D
to follow your heart
Em                      C
Tears don't mean you're losing
            G
everybody's bruising
                D
Just be true to who you are
Em
No no no no
