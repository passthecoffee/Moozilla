## married to my pickup truck

[G]I'm getting married to my p[C]ickup truck  
[D]It never leaves me when I'm [G]down on my luck  
[G]It doesn't shop at f[C]ancy stores  
Or have a [D]lawyer, or want a divorce  
[G]it doesn't care if I [C]stay out late  
[D]It doesn't bitch about the[G] money I make  
We'll be together til[C]l the end [D]  
It won't sleep with my best friend  
[C]I'm gonna get down Don one knee,  
[C]And ask my truck if it'll[D] marry me  
[C]I'll never drive an[D]other car,  
[C]We'll honeymoon at the ti[D]tty bar  
[G]I'm gonna have the t[C]ime of my life  
The exh[D]aust pipes are tighter than my ex-wife  
[G]You think I'm crazy but l[C]isten to this  
I can br[D]ing home a hooker and it won't get pissed, no  
[G]Wedding ring won't co[C]st me a buck,  
when I[D]'m getting married to my pickup, pickup t[G]ruck
