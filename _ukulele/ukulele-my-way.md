## My Way
[Verse 1].  
And [C]now, the end is [Em]near,  
And so I [Gm]face, the final [A7]curtain.  
My [Dm]friend, I'll say it [Dm7]clear,  
I'll state my [G7]case, of which I'm [C]certain.  
I've [C]lived, a life thats [C7]full,  
I've traveled [F]each, and every [Fm]highway.  
But [C]more, much more than [G7]this,  
I did it[F] my [C]way.  
  
  
[Verse 2].  
[C]Regrets, I've had a [Em]few,  
But then [Gm]again, too few to [A7]mention.  
I [Dm]did, what I had to [Dm7]do,  
And saw it [G7]through, without [C]exemption.  
I [C]planned, each chartered [C7]course,  
Each careful [F]step, along the [Fm]byway.  
But [C]more, much more than [G7]this,  
I did it[F] my [C]way.  
  
  
[B section].                                     
[C]Yes, there were times, I'm sure you [C7]knew,  
When I bit [F]off, more than I could [F7]chew.  
But through it [Dm]all, when there was [G7]doubt,  
I ate it [Em]up, and spit it [Am]out.  
I faced it [Dm]all, and I stood [G7]tall,  
I did it[Fm] my [C]way.  
  
  
[Verse 3].  
I've [C]loved, I've laughed and [Em]cried,  
I've had my [Gm]fill, my share of [A7]losing.  
And [Dm]now, as tears sub[Dm7]side,  
I find it [G7]all so a[C]musing.  
[C]To think, I did all [C7]that,  
And may I [F]say, not in a [Fm]shy way.  
Oh [C]no, no not [G7]me,  
I did it[F] my [C]way.  
  
  
[B section].  
[C]For what is a man, what has he [C7]got,  
If not him[F]self, then he has [F7]naught.  
To say the [Dm]things, he truely [G7]feels,  
And not the [Em]words, of one who [Am]kneels.  
The record [Dm]shows, I took the [G7]blows,  
I did it[Fm] my [C]way.
