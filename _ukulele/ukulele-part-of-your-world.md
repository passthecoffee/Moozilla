Intro: Bb-C [x2]  
Verse 1:  
Look[G] at this stuff, Isn't[A] it neat?  
Woul[G]dn't you think my col[A]lection's complete?  
Wou[F#m]ldn't you think I'm the [Bm]one  
The one who ha[Esus4]s every[E]thing?  
  
[G]Look at this trove, [A]Treasures untold  
[G]How many wonders, can [A]one cavern hold?  
[F#m]Lookin' around here you'd [Bm]think  
(Sure)[Esus4] they've got every[E]thing  
I've got [Bb]gadgets and [C]gizmos, aplenty  
I've got [Am]whozit's and [Dm]whatzit's galore  
You want [G]thing'a'mabobs?, I got [A]twenty  
But who [F#m]cares?, No big [Bm]deal  
I want [A]more...  
  
Chorus 1:  
[D]I wanna be where the [F#m]people are  
[G]I wanna see, Wanna [A]see 'em dancin'  
[Bm]Walkin' around on those  
[F#m]Whad'ya call 'em? oh [A]feet  
[D]Flippin' your fins you don't [F#m]get too far  
[G]Legs are required for [A]jumpin', dancin'  
[Bm]Strollin' along down a[F#m]?  
What's that word again?... [A]street  
Up where they [D]walk, Up where they [D7]run  
Up where they [G]stay all day in the [Gm]sun  
Wanderin' fr[Dm]ee, Wish I could [A]be  
Part of your [D]world  
  
Verse 2:  
What would I [G]give  
If I could [A]live  
Outta these [F#m]waters?[Bm]  
What would I [G]pay  
To spend a [A]day  
Warm on the [F#m]sand? [D7]-[D]  
Betcha on [G]land  
They under[A]stand  
Bet they don't[F#m] reprimand their [Bm]daughters  
Bright young [Esus4]women  
Sick o' [E]swimmin'  
Ready to[C] stand[A]  
  
Chorus 2:  
  
And I [D]ready to know what the [F#m]people know  
[G]Ask 'em my questions  
And [A]get some answers  
[Bm]What's a fire and [F#m]why does it  
What's the word?, [A]burn?  
When's it my [D]turn?  
Wouldn't I [D7]love  
Love to ex[G]plore that shore a[G]mbove?  
Out of the [Bm]sea  
W[C]ish I could be  
Part of that [D]world  
  
Bridge:  
  
Part of that [G]world  
Part of that [A]world  
I re[F#m]fuse to stop that [Bm]right to spinning  
Part of your [G]world  
Part of your [A]world  
For fun use to be gally for I'm with you now!!!  
  
[Repeat Chorus 1]
