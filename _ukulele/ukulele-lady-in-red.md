[Verse 1]  
I've ne[G]ver seen you looking so lo[Em]vely, as you did ton[D]ight.  
I've never seen you shine so br[Em]ight... o[D]oo... o[C]oo  
I've ne[G]ver seen so many men as[Em]king if you wanted to da[D]nce.  
They're looking for a little rom[Em]ance, given h[D]alf a ch[C]ance.  
And I have never seen that dress you're wea[Am]ring.  
Or the hig[D]hlights in your hair that catch your ey[Em]es.  
I have been bli[D]nd.  
  
[Chorus]  
The lady in r[G]ed,[C] is dan[D]cing with m[Em]e.... Cheek to cheek.  
There's nobody he[Am]re,[D] it's just you and m[G]e.  
It's where I want to be[G7].  
But I hardly kn[C]ow th[F#]is beauty by my s[Em]ide [D], [C].  
I'll never f[Am]orget.... T[D]he way you look ton[G]ight.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've ne[G]ver seen you looking so go[Em]rgeous as you did ton[D]ight,  
I've never seen you shine so[Em] bright, you we[D]re ama[C]zing,  
I've ne[G]ver seen so many people wa[Em]nt to be there by your si[D]de,  
And when you turned to me and sm[Em]iled, it took my breath aw[C]ay,  
And I have ne[Am]ver had such a feeling,  
Such a f[D]eeling of complete and utter l[Em]ove, as I d[C]o toni[D]ght,  
  
[Chorus]  
The lady in [G]red,[C] is danc[D]ing with [Em]me.... Cheek to cheek.  
There's nobody h[Am]ere, [D]it's just you and [G]me.  
It's where I want to [G7]be.  
But I hardly k[C]now [F#]this beauty by my s[Em]ide [D], [C].  
I'll never fo[Am]rget.... T[D]he way you look ton[G]ight.  
  
[Outro]  
T[G]he lady in Red, my lady in red, my lady in red,  
my la[Em]dy in R[G]ed.  
I love you.
