MONSTERS


[Intro]
C - - -


[Verse]
C                                 Am
Oh, before they turn off all the lights,

I won’t read you your wrongs or your
F
rights.
              C
The time has gone,
C
Oh I’ll tell you goodnight close the
Am
door,
                           F
I Tell you I love you once more,
              C
The time has gone,
           G
So here it is

[Chorus]
             F                   G
I’m not your son, you’re not my father
           C
We’re just two grown men saying
    Am
goodbye
   F                   G
No need to forgive, no need to forget
        C
I know your mistakes and you know
 Am
mine,
              F
while you’re sleeping I’ll try to make
    G
you proud
     C
So, daddy, won’t you just close your
 Am
eyes?
          F              G
Don’t be afraid, it’s my turn
                      C
To chase the monsters away

[Bridge]

C
Sleep a lifetime
         Am
Yes and breathe a last word
        F                     G                        G
You can feel my hand on your own

[Chorus]
                 F                   G
Coz I’m not your son, you’re not my father
           C
We’re just two grown men saying
    Am
goodbye
   F                   G
No need to forgive, no need to forget
        C
I know your mistakes and you know
 Am
mine,
              F
while you’re sleeping I’ll try to make
    G
you proud
     C
So, daddy, won’t you just close your
 Am
eyes?
          F              G
Don’t be afraid, it’s my turn
                      C
To chase the monsters away
