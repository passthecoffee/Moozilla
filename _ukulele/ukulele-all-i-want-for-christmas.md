[Verse 1]  
[G]I don't want a lot for Christmas  
[G]/[B]There's just one thing I need  
[C]I don't care about the presents  
[Cm]/[Eb]Underneath the Christmas tree  
[G]I just want you for my [B7]own  
[Em]More than you could ever [Cm]know  
[G]Make my wish come [E7]true  
[Am7]All I want for [D7]Christmas is...  
You...[G]...[Em]...[C]...[D]..  
  
[Verse 2]  
[G]I don't want a lot for Christmas  
[G]/[B]There's just one thing I need  
[C]I don't care about the presents  
[Cm]/[Eb]Underneath the Christmas tree  
[G]I don't need to hang my stocking  
[G]There upon the fireplace  
[C]Santa Claus won't make me happy  
[Cm]With a toy on Christmas day  

[Chorus]
[G]I just want you for my [B7]own  
[Em]More than you could ever [Cm]know  
[G]Make my wish come [E7]true  
[Am7]All I want for [D7]Christmas is you  
[G]You...[Em]...[C]...[D]baby  
  
[Verse 3]  
[G]I won't ask for much this Christmas  
[G/B]I don't even wish for snow  
[C]I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
[Cm/Eb]Underneath the mistletoe  
[G]I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
[C]I won't even stay awake to  
[Cm]Hear those magic reindeers click  
  
[Chorus]  
[G]'Cause I just want you here to[B7]night  
[Em]Holding on to me so [Cm]tight  
[G]What more can I [E7]do  
[Am7]Baby all I want for [D7]Christmas is  
[G]you[Em]..[C]Oo[D]h baby  
  
[Verse 4]  
[B7]All the lights are shining  
So [Em]brightly everywhere  
[B7]And the sound of children's  
[Em]Laughter fills the air  
[Cm]And everyone is singing  
[G]I hear those [E7]sleigh bells ringing  
[Am7]Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you [C]please bring my baby to me...  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh [G]I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
[C]I just want to see my baby  
[Cm]Standing right outside my door  
  
[Chorus]  
[G]Oh I just want you for my [B7]own  
[Em]More than you could ever [Cm]know  
[G]Make my wish come [E7]true  
Baby [Am7]all I want for [D7]Christmas is...  
[G]You...[Em]...[C]...[D]...  
  
[Outro]  
[G]All I want for [Em]Christmas is [C]you... [D]baby (repeat)
