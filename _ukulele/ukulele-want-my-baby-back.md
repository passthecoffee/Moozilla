[C]Darling when we met  
you were a [Am]pretty little thing  
but your [Dm]body started changing  
when I [G]gave you that ring  
 
you're super si[C]zing  
no exerc[Am]ising  
[Dm]goodbye working o[G]ut  
a double m[C]eat with cheese  
another h[Am]airpin please  
baby [Dm]that's what you're all ab[G]out  

[Em]I pick you up in my pickup truck  
but you [Am]had to ride in the back  
[Em]I stopped off at the sonic-burger  
you ate [Am]everything in my sack  
Darling p[Dm]lease  
won't you please think of m[G]e  
I'd love to have my baby ba[C]ck  
[Am]my baby back, [Dm]my baby back[G]  

[C]Six months of passing, you've gained 50 pounds  
and I con[Am]fess you've got a real big rack  
but the [Dm]bad part is, when I give you a hug  
you've got a tumo[G]ur on your back  
  
you're super siz[C]ing  
no exerci[Am]sing  
[Dm]goodbye working o[G]ut  
a double m[C]eat with cheese  
another h[Am]airpin please  
baby tha[Dm]t's what you're all ab[G]out

[Em]I played football with the boys last night  
and you were [Am]all-time quarterback  
[Em]but none of us could ever tackle you  
[Am]coz you're built like a lumberjack, darling p[Dm]lease  
won't you please think of m[G]e  
I'd love to have my baby ba[C]ck  
put down the ri[Am]bs  
my baby ba[Dm]ck  
and baby[G] come back to me,[C] yeah
