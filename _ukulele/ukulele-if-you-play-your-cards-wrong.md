## If you play your cards wrong

If you p[G]lay your cards wrong, you can ta[C]ke me home tonight  
[D]You've got all the makings of m[C]y futu[D]re ex-w[G]ife  
[G]I've got three bucks my credit sucks and my fu[C]ture don't look too bright  
so if you pl[D]ay your cards wrong, you can t[C]ake me hoDme tonig[G]ht  
Some c[E]mall me a loser and a [C]lazy no-good slob  
I've lost my [Em]house, I've got no car  
and [D]I can't keep a job  
but I've [C]got a big heart, and anoth[D]er part  
Take me h[Em]ome you'll understand  
[C]Because my genit[D]alia looks l[C]ike a p[D]ringles c[G]an  
  
If you p[C]lay your cards w[D]rong, you can [Em]take me home tonight  
and [G]when I pull my pants down,  
hey you won't believe i'm white  
and i[G]t's been said that I'm mister ed,  
but don't [C]worry I won't bite  
if you p[D]lay your cards wrong,  
you can [C]take me h[D]ome ton[G]ight  
Some c[E]mall me dishonest  
And they s[C]ay I'm just lying  
But [Em]I've peed next to old john holmes and [D]He started crying.  
On a s[C]unny day, I'v[D]e got it made,  
[Em]Get under my wiener if you need shade  
  
I[G]f you play your cards wrong, you can take me home tonight  
I[G]f you play your cards wrong, you can take me home tonight
