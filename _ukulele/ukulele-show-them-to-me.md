[G]Oh it seems to me this whole wo[D]rld's gone cr[Em]azy  
there's t[C]oo much hate and killin' going o[D]n  
but w[G]hen I see the [D]bare chest of a wo[Em]man  
my wo[C]rries and my problems are a[D]ll gone  
[C]noone thinks of fighting when they [D]see a topless girl  
[Em]maybe if you would show yours too, [C]we could save the w[D]orld  
Show them to m[G]e, Show [D]them to m[Em]e  
[C]unclasp your bra and set those puppies fr[D]ee  
they'd look a wh[G]ole lot better without that sw[D]eater,  
ba[Em]by i'm sure you'll agree  
baby you[C]'ve got two funbags[D]  
show them to m[G]e  
  
[G]I don't care if they don't [D]match or o[Em]ne's bigger than the other  
[C]you can show me one, [D]and I'll imagine the other  
[G]even if you're really o[D]ld  
[Em]there's nothing wrong  
[C]don't be sad, your boobs ain't bad,  
they're j[D]ust a little long  
show them to me[G], show [D]them to m[Em]e  
lift Cup your shirt, and let the whole wor[D]ld see  
[G]adjust this robe, show your glo[D]bes,  
and a [Em]happy man i'll be  
if y[C]ou've got dos chichis [D]  
show them to me[G]  
  
  
[C]i've met a lot of them, but nev[D]er one i've hated  
[C]even if you've had 13 kids and you th[D]ink they look deflated  
there's n[C]o such thing as a bad breast, i belie[D]ve this much is true  
[C]if you're a big fat man, i'm a tittie fan,  
and i'd [D](let ring) love to see yours too  
  
  
show them to me [G], show t[D]hem to me[Em]  
just li[C]ke the girls gone wild on T[D]V  
[G]just lean back and show your [D]rack, and i[Em]'ll be in extacy  
[C]if you got two cosabas [D]  
show them to me[G]
[Em]come on baby let me see  
Call the world will live in harmony[D]  
[G]it'll do you good, and it'll give m[D]e wood  
[Em]we'll make history  
[C](let ring)if you love your country  
i'm gonna say it one more time  
I said if y[C]ou love your c[D]ountry  
then stand your ass up and show them big old titties to me
