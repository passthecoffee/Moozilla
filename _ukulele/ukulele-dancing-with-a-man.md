## Dancin' with a man
A B E                                 
[E]I saw her sitting in a bar room[A]  
In that s[B7]mokey atmos[E]phere  
She smiled back at me  
As I drank that one last b[B7]eer  
Then she [A]pulled me on the [B7]dance [E]floor  
And we danced a song or [E]two  
It was [A]then I realized[B7]  
I Had bit off more than I can chew[E]
  
I think I’m Dancin' With A M[A]an  
She got [B7]calluses on her [E]hand  
She’s got a voice like Johnny Ca[A]sh  
Is she hiding a [B7]mustache  
I think I’m Dancin' With A M[E]an.  
  
[E]We sat down and talked awhile  
And we listened to the [A]band  
Oh then a friend of mine [E]walked by  
And he asked her if she'd da[B7]nce  
And he gently took her [A]hand, oooh [B7]oooh  
And he twirled her round and [E]round  
It looked like he was having f[A]un[B7]  
Until her skirt fell to the [E]ground.  
  
I think he's Dancin' With A M[A]an[B7]  
The boys at the lodge won't under[E]stand  
As they two stepped across the [A]floor  
I quickly headed for the [B7]door  
I think he's Dancin' With A M[E]an.  
  
Good Lord were Dancin' With A M[A]an[B7]  
It will be known through out the [E]land  
Two boys from Texas danced a g[A]ig  
With a dude who wore a w[B7]ig  
We've been Dancin' With A Man[E]  
She crushed a beer can on her h[A]ead  
Good Lord her foreheads [B7]red  
We've been Dancin' With A Man damn b[E]ig Man  
  
Alternate verse 2 (Live version)  
I think I’m Dancin' With A M[A]an[B7]  
She got calluses on her [E]hand  
She’s got a voice deeper than m[A]ine  
Is she gets a stiffy when we g[B7]rind  
I think I’m Dancin' With A M[E]an.  
  
Alternate Verse 3 (Live version)  
I think he's Dancin' With A M[A]an[B7]  
The boys at the lodge won't under[E]stand  
With her hand on his [A]behind  
They two stepped til half past [B7]nine  
I think he's Dancin' With A [E]Man.  
  
Alternate Verse 4 (Live Version)  
Ahhh s**t, I think were Dancin' With A M[A]an[B7]  
It will be known through out the [E]land  
Two boys from Texas danced a [A]gig  
With a dude who wore a [B7]wig  
We've been Dancin' With A M[E]an.
