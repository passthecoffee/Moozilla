[VERSE]

C                 G               Am          Em
Have you seen the old man, in the closed-down market
F              C                D7       G7
picking up the papers, with his worn-out shoes?
C               G             Am                Em
In his eyes you see no pride, hand held loosely by his side
F           C               G7          C
yesterday's papers, telling yesterday's news


[CHORUS]

C      F           Em              C         Am
    So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
D7            D7                     G      G7
  and say for you that the sun don't shine?
C               G                Am                   Em
Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
F               C             G7                   C      C
  I'll show you something, to make you change your mind


[VERSE]

C                 G            Am                   Em
Have you seen the old gal, who walks the streets of London
F           C             D7         G7
dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?
C                 G                 Am             Em
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
F            C        G7            C
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags


[CHORUS]

C      F           Em              C         Am
    So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
D7            D7                     G      G7
  and say for you that the sun don't shine?
C               G                Am                   Em
Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
F               C             G7                   C      C
  I'll show you something, to make you change your mind


[VERSE]

C                    G          Am           Em
And in the all-night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
F        C                D7           G7
some old man sitting there, all on his own
C               G             Am          Em
Looking at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup
F                 C             G7           C
Each day lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone


[CHORUS]

C      F           Em              C         Am
    So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
D7            D7                     G      G7
  and say for you that the sun don't shine?
C               G                Am                   Em
Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
F               C             G7                   C      C
  I'll show you something, to make you change your mind


[VERSE]

C                     G        Am                 Em
And have you seen the old man, outside the seaman's mission?
F            C                  D7                    G7
His memory's fading, with those medal ribbons that he wears
C                 G         Am                Em
And in our winter city, the rain cries little pity
F                      C            G7                C
For one more forgotten hero, and a world that doesn't care


[CHORUS]

C      F           Em              C         Am
    So how can you tell me, you're lo - ne - ly
D7            D7                     G      G7
  and say for you that the sun don't shine?
C               G                Am                   Em
Let me take you by the hand, and lead you through the streets of London
F               C             G7                   C      C
  I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
