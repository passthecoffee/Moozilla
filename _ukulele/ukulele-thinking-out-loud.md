Verse 1  
[C] When your [Am]legs don't work  
Like they [F]used to befor[G]e  
[C] And I can't [Am]sweep you off of your[F] fee[G]t  
[C] Will your [Am]mouth still remember  
the [F]taste of my lov[G]e  
[C] Will your [Am]eyes still smile  
[F]from your cheek[G]s  
  
And darling [C]I w[Am]ill be loving [F]you '[G]til we're seve[C]nty[Am][F],[G]  
And baby [C]my he[Am]art could still fall [F]as [G]hard at [C]twenty-[Am]three  
[F]And I'm thinking '[G]bout how  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
[Dm]People fall in love in [G]mysterious [C]ways  
[Dm]Maybe just the touch of a [G]hand  
Well [Dm]me I fall in love with you [Am]every single day  
[Dm]And I just wanna [G]tell [G]you [G]I [G]am  
  
[Chorus]  
So honey [C]no[Am]w, [F],  
Take me [G]into your loving [C]arm[Am]s, [F],  
Kiss me [G]under the light of a [C]thousand [Am]stars,[F],  
Place your [G]head on my beating [C]hear[Am]t  
I'm thinking [F]out [G]loud  
And maybe [Am]we  [C]found [F]love [C]right [F]where [G]we [C]are  
  
[Verse 2]  
[C] And when my [Am]hair's all but gone and [F]my memory [G]fades  
[C] And the [Am]crowds don't remember [F]my [G]name  
[C] When my [Am]hands don't [F]play the strings the [G]same [C]way, mmm  
I know [Am]you will still [F]love me the [G]same  
  
Cause honey [C]your [Am]soul could never [F]grow [G]old it's [C]ever[Am]green[F], [G],  
And baby [C]your [Am]smile's forever [F]in my [G]mind and [C]memo[Am]ry, [F],  
And I'm thinking '[G]bout how  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
[Dm]People fall in love in [G]mysterious [C]ways  
And [Dm]maybe it's all part of a [G]plan  
Well [Dm]I'll just keep on making the [Am]same [Am]mistakes  
[Dm]Hoping that you'll [G]under[G]stan[G]d  
  
[Chorus]  
That baby [C]now, [Am]oooo[F]oh  
Take me [G]into your loving [C]arm[Am]s[F]  
Kiss me [G]under the light of a [C]thousand [Am]star[F]s  
Place your [G]head on my beating [C]hear[Am]t  
I'm thinking [F]out [G]loud  
And maybe [Am]we  [C]found [F]love [C]right [F]where [G]we [C]are

Place your [G]head on my beating [C]hear[Am]t  
I'm thinking [F]out [G]loud  
  
[Outro]  
And maybe [Am]we [C]found [F]love [C]right [F]where [G]we [C]are
