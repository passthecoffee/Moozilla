[Verse 1]
C          Am
 When your legs don't work
          F             G
Like they used to before
C            Am                   F    G
 And I can't sweep you off of your feet
C          Am
 Will your mouth still remember
    F               G
the taste of my love
C          Am
 Will your eyes still smile
F               G
from your cheeks

            C  Am           F    G              C   Am  F  G
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're seventy
           C   Am                   F  G           C    Am
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
F                 G
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Dm                        G
Maybe just the touch of a hand
     Dm                            Am
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
Dm                 G (5 strums) -stop
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
         C    Am  F
So honey now
        G                C   Am  F
Take me into your loving arms
        G                    C           Am  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
           G                  C     Am
Place your head on my beating heart
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am   C    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
C            Am                     F           G
 And when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
C        Am                      F    G
 And the crowds don't remember my name
C        Am         F                    G           C
 When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
       Am                        F    G
I know you will still love me the same

              C   Am             F    G                 C  Am  F  G
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           C    Am           F     G            C  Am  F
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
                  G
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Dm                       G        C
People fall in love in mysterious ways
    Dm                       G
And maybe it's all part of a plan
     Dm                           Am     Am
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Dm             G (5 strums) -stop
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
          C    Am F
That baby now, oooooh
        G                C   Am  F
Take me into your loving arms
        G                    C           Am  F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
           G                  C     Am
Place your head on my beating heart
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud
          Am   C    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are

[Chorus]
        C   Am F
So baby now
        G                C   Am  F
Take me into your loving arms
        G                    C           Am    F
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darlin'
           G                  C     Am
Place your head on my beating heart
             F     G
I'm thinking out loud

[Outro]
          Am   G    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are
          Am   G    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are
          Am   G    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are
          Am   G    F   C      F     G C
And maybe we  found love right where we are
