[Verse]  
[C]Why should I feel discouraged,  
[F]Why should the shadows come[C], [G/B],  
[G]Why should my heart be[A7] lonely,[D],[F],  
[G]And long for heav'n and home[C],[G]  
When Jesus[C] is my portion,  
A constan[G]t Fri[C]end is He[F]; [A7],[D],  
His [C]eye is on the sparro[F]w, [A]  
And I kno[C/G]w He watch[G]es me. [C]
  
[Chorus:]  
I[G] sing because I'm happy,[C]  
I[G] sing because I'm free;[C]  
For His eye is on the sparrow,[F/A]  
And I kn[C/G]ow He watch[G]es me.[C]  
  
[Verse]  
\"Let not your heart be troubled,\"  
His tender word I hear,  
And resting on His goodness,  
I lose my doubts and fears,  
Tho' by the path he leadeth,  
But one step I may see;  
His eye is on the sparrow,  
And I know He watches me.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whenever I am tempted,  
Whenever clouds arise,  
When song gives place to sighing,  
When hope within me dies,  
I draw the closer to Him;  
From care He sets me free;  
His eye is on the sparrow,  
And I know He watches me.
