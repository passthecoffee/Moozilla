## 2002

[Verse 1]
I will always rem[D]ember  
The d[D]ay you kissed my lips  
Lig[A]ht as a fea[Bm]ther  
And it we[Bm]nt just like this  
No, it[F#m]'s never been [G]better  
Than the sum[A]mer of 200[D]2  
We were only e[D]leven  
But ac[D]ting like grownups  
Like w[A]e are in the [Bm]present  
Drinking[Bm] from plastic cups  
Singing l[F#m]ove is f[G]orever and ever[A]  
Well, I guess that was t[D]rue  
  
Da[Bm]ncing on the hood in the mi[G]ddle of the woods  
Of an o[D]ld Mustang, w[A]here we sang  
So[G]ngs with all our childhood fr[A]iends  
And it went like this, say  
  
Chorus:  
O[G]ops I g[D]ot 99 p[A]roblems singing bye, bye, [Bm]bye  
Hold up, i[G]f you wanna go and take a [D]ride with me  
Better h[A]it me, baby, one more t[Bm]ime  
Pa[G]int a picture for y[D]ou and me  
Of the da[A]ys when we were y[Bm]oung  
Sin[G]ging at the top of both our l[A]ungs  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now we're under the co[D]vers  
Fast fo[D]rward to eighteen  
We are mo[A]re than lo[Bm]vers  
Yeah, w[Bm]e are all we need  
When we'r[F#m]e holding e[G]ach other  
I'm taken ba[A]ck to 2002[D]  
Yeah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Da[Bm]ncing on the hood in the mi[G]ddle of the woods
Of an o[D]ld Mustang, w[A]here we sang
So[G]ngs with all our childhood fr[A]iends
And it went like this, say

[Chorus]
O[G]ops I g[D]ot 99 p[A]roblems singing bye, bye, [Bm]bye
Hold up, i[G]f you wanna go and take a [D]ride with me
Better h[A]it me, baby, one more t[Bm]ime
Pa[G]int a picture for y[D]ou and me
Of the da[A]ys when we were y[Bm]oung
Sin[G]ging at the top of both our l[A]ungs
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]

[Pre-Chorus]
Da[Bm]ncing on the hood in the mi[G]ddle of the woods
Of an o[D]ld Mustang, w[A]here we sang
So[G]ngs with all our childhood fr[A]iends
Oh, now

[Chorus]
O[G]ops I g[D]ot 99 p[A]roblems singing bye, bye, [Bm]bye
Hold up, i[G]f you wanna go and take a [D]ride with me
Better h[A]it me, baby, one more t[Bm]ime
Pa[G]int a picture for y[D]ou and me
Of the da[A]ys when we were y[Bm]oung
Sin[G]ging at the top of both our l[A]ungs
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]
On the day we fell in lo[D]ve [A],[Bm],[G]                        G
On the day we fell in lo[G]ve, love, love
