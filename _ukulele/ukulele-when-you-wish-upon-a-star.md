## When You Wish Up-On A Star
[Intro]. G Am D G, Am C G  
[Verse].  
[G]When you wish up-on[Am] a star,  
[D]Makes no difference [G]who you are,  
Anything your [Am]heart desires  
Will [C]come to [G]you.  
  
[G]If your heart is [Am]in your dream,  
[D]No request is [G]too extreme,  
When you wish up-[Am]on a star  
As [C]dreamers [G]do.  
  
[Bridge].  
[C]Fate is k[G]ind, [D]she brings to [G]those who love  
[Em]The sweet fulf[A]illment of their secret [Am]long-[D]ing.  
  
[Verse].  
[G]Like a bolt out [Am]of the blue,  
[D]Fate steps in and [G]sees you through;  
When you wish u[Am]pon a star,  
Your [C]dre-ams [D]co-me [G]tru-e.  
  
[Outro].
