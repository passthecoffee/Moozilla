[Verse]  
I've [C]made up my mind,  
Don't [G]need to think it over  
If I'm wr[Am]ong, I am right  
Don't [Em]need to look no further,  
This ain't [F]lust  
I [Em]know this is [C]love  
B[Em]ut, if [C]I tell the world  
I'll [G]never say enough  
'cause it was [Am]not said to you  
And that's [F]exactly what I need to do  
If [Am]I end u[Em]p with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Sh[F]ould I give [G]up,  
Or should I [Am]just keep chasin' pavements?  
[Em]Even if it [F]leads [G]nowhere  
Or [F]would it be a [C]waste  
Even [G]if I knew my [Am]place  
[F]Should I [G]leave it there  
Sh[F]ould I give [G]up,  
Or should I [Am]just keep chasin' pavements?  
[Em]Even if it [F]leads [G]nowhere  
  
[Verse]  
I [C]build myself up  
And [G]fly around in circles  
Waitin' [Am]as my heart drops  
And my [F]back begins to tingle  
[Am]Finally, [Em]could this be it
