<p>[Verse]</p>

<p>*C
I’ve made up my mind,
 *G
Don’t need to think it over
     *Am
If I’m wrong, I am right
*Em
Don’t need to look no further,
*F
This ain’t lust
   *Em             *C
I know this is love
*Em   C
But, if I tell the world
G
I’ll never say enough
Am
‘cause it was not said to you
   F
And that’s exactly what I need to do
Am       Em
If I end up with you</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>F             G
Should I give up,
   Am   <br />
Or should I just keep chasin’ pavements?
Em         F     G
Even if it leads nowhere
F                C
Or would it be a waste
G                Am
Even if I knew my place
F                G
Should I leave it there
F             G
Should I give up,
   Am
Or should I just keep chasin’ pavements
Em         F     G
Even if it leads nowhere</p>

<p>[Verse]</p>

<p>C
I build myself up
G
And fly around in circles
Am
Waitin’ as my heart drops
F
And my back begins to tingle
Am            Em
Finally, could this be it</p>
